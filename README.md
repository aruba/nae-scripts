# Overview


Aruba Network Analytics Engine Scripts are troubleshooting solutions that 
allow the administrator to monitor data of a specific resource
(protocol/system) and capture time series snapshot of various possible
states that this resource can transition to.

The administrator creates scripts that are based on NAE framework. A script 
indicates what data should be monitored, specifies conditions which act as 
triggers on the monitored data, specifies pre-defined actions 
(e.g. syslog, cli commands, etc) that can be executed when the condition is
met, or indicate callback actions which are nothing but python functions to
be executed when the condition is met.

Once the Network Analytics Script is uploaded and instantiated, Time Series
data collection will begin, based on the data that is monitored. The 
administrator views Time Series data associated with Network Analytics Agents
as charts on the Web UI.

# Repository Structure:

Structure of the “nae-scripts” repository is as shown below
<pre>
	├── common
	├── 8400
	├── 832X
	├── genericx86
	├── README.md
</pre>
The repository structure is defined by grouping the NAE Script and their documentaiton 
files on directories representing the device platform and topics, as follows:

Inside each folder, the user will find another folder that contains scripts and 
documentation that are published (or available to download): 
<pre>
	├── interface_state_stats_monitor.1.0.md
	└── interface_state_stats_monitor.1.0.py
</pre>

`<platform>/<topic>/<script-name>.<version>(.py|.md)`

Where:
 
  * `<platform>` defines the device hardware platform (e.g. 8400, 832X, etc.)
  * `<topic>` defines a context for the scripts:
    * ase: The official NAE Scripts curated by Aruba Networks
    * ondevice: NAE Scripts that comes installed with the device
    * examples: NAE Scripts that could be used as examples during the development of other NAE Scripts.
  * `<script-name>` usually says what device feature the script is related to (e.g. `power_supply_monitor.1.0.py`)
  * `<version>` the version of the NAE Script
  * `.py` the NAE Script source code that can be installed on a device
  * `.md` the documentation about a given NAE Script
